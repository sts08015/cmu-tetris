# Tetris

This is **tetris game** build with **tkinter, python!!**

I made this game because this was assignment of **course 15-112 at CMU** 



I think there are some issues remaining with **pause** and step option, but those issues are just only minor problems to enjoy the game!!



## Keys

left arrow  : move left

right arrow : move right

down arrow  : move down

up arrow    : rotate counter-clockwise

space       : **Hard Drop (immediate drop)**
