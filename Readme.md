# Tetris

This is **tetris game** build with **tkinter, python!!**

I made this game because this was assignment of **course 15-112 at CMU** 



I think there are some issues remaining with **pause** and step option, but those issues are just only minor problems to enjoy the game!!



## Keys

left : move left

right : move right

down : move down

up : rotate counter-clockwise

space : **Hard Drop**
